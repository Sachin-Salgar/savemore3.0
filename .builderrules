# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1\. Overview

**App Name:** SaveMore

SaveMore is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to digitize and streamline Self Help Group (SHG) management across multiple communities. The app empowers group members to manage their monthly savings deposits, track loan disbursements, and monitor repayment schedules through an intuitive mobile-first interface. Group presidents can efficiently manage their members' financial records, while an administrative layer provides oversight and approval capabilities for new group registrations.

**Target Audience:** Self Help Group members, group presidents, and SHG coordinators across rural and urban communities seeking digital financial management solutions.

**Problem Solved:** Traditional SHG management relies on manual record-keeping, leading to transparency issues, calculation errors, and difficulty tracking multiple groups. SaveMore provides a centralized, transparent, and user-friendly platform that ensures accurate financial tracking, improves member trust, and enables efficient multi-group administration.
