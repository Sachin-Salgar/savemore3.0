### Important Notes

2. Select your CSV file from your computer
3. The system will validate the file and show a preview
4. If validation errors exist, they will be highlighted

## Troubleshooting

### Validation Errors

**"Invalid email format"**
- The email address doesn't contain the `@` symbol or is missing a domain

**"Name is required"**
- The name field is empty or missing

**"Insufficient columns in row"**
- The row has fewer columns than the header

### Common Issues

**"Member is already part of this group"**
- This member's email is already added to this group
- You cannot add the same member twice

**"CSV file is empty"**
- The file you uploaded contains no data rows

**"CSV must have "email" and "name" columns"**
- The header row doesn't contain both required columns
- Check the column names and ensure they match exactly

## Permission Levels

### Member

## Best Practices

1. **Validate Data Before Upload**
   - Use the preview feature to check your data
   - Ensure all emails are unique and valid
   - Review phone numbers for correct format

2. **Use the Sample Template**
   - Always start with the downloaded sample
   - Don't add or remove columns
   - Keep the exact column names

3. **Batch Upload Tips**
   - Upload members in batches of 100 or less for best performance
   - If a large upload has errors, fix them and try again
   - Check the error report after upload

4. **Follow Naming Conventions**
   - Use full names for clarity
   - Keep names concise and consistent
   - Include middle names if available

## Member Approval Workflow

After uploading members:

1. Members are added with **Pending** status
2. Members need to be **Approved** by the group president
3. Once approved, members become **Active**
4. Active members can:
   - View their savings balance
   - Apply for loans
   - View transaction history
