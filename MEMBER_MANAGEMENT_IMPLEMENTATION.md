// Add single member
await addMember(groupId, {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  name: 'John Doe',
  phone: '1234567890'
})

// Add multiple members from CSV
const result = await addMultipleMembers(groupId, members)
// Returns: { success: number, failed: number, errors: Array }
```

### New Utilities Created

#### 4. **CSV Helper** (`src/utils/csvHelper.ts`)
- CSV parsing with validation
- Column detection (email, name, phone)
- Row-level error handling
- Sample CSV generation
- CSV download functionality

**Functions:**
```typescript
parseCSV(csvContent: string) // Parse and validate CSV

```

## Integration Points

- AddMembersModal integration
- Success callback to refresh member list

**URL:** `/members`

### 2. **Admin Members Page** (`src/pages/AdminMembers.tsx`)
**New page with:**
- Group selection for member management
- Add Members button per group
- Member stats and listing
- Modal integration

**Access:** Admins only
**URL:** `/admin/members`

### 3. **Layout Component** (`src/components/Layout.tsx`)
**Updated with:**
- Conditional menu items based on user role
- Members link for presidents
- Members link for admins
- Admin section in hamburger menu

### 4. **AdminDashboard** (`src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
**Updated with:**
- Members management button linking to `/admin/members`
- Improved icon and description

### 5. **App Router** (`src/App.tsx`)
**Added routes:**
```typescript
<Route path="/members" element={<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="president"><Members /></ProtectedRoute>} />
<Route path="/admin/members" element={<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="admin"><AdminMembers /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```

## Permission Model

### Member Role
- ❌ Cannot add members
- ✅ Can view group members
- ✅ Can access own profile

### President Role
- ✅ Can add members to own group only
- ✅ Can approve/reject member applications
- ✅ Can view all members in their group
- ✅ Access via `/members` page

### Admin Role
- ✅ Can add members to any group
- ✅ Can select specific group
- ✅ Can view members across all groups
- ✅ Access via `/admin/members` page

## Data Flow

### Single Member Addition
```
User Input → AddMembersModal → useAddMembers → 
  Supabase Auth (create user) → 
  user_profiles table (create profile) → 
  group_members table (add to group, status: pending) → 
  Success callback
```

### Batch CSV Upload
```
CSV File → parseCSV → Validation → 
  Loop: addMember() for each row → 
  Error collection → 
  Results summary → 
  Success callback
```

## CSV Format Specification

### Required Columns
- `email` - Email address (must be unique)
- `name` - Full name (required)
- `phone` - Phone number (optional)

### Example
```csv
email,name,phone
john.doe@example.com,John Doe,9876543210
jane.smith@example.com,Jane Smith,9876543211
```

### Validation Rules
- Email format: must contain @
- Name: cannot be empty
- Phone: optional but recommended
- No duplicate emails in same group

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Invalid email format
- Missing required name field
- Insufficient columns
- Empty CSV file
- Wrong CSV headers

### Business Logic Errors
- User already exists (handled gracefully)
- Member already in group
- Group not found
- Database constraint violations

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages in modal
- Row-level error reports in CSV preview
- Success summary after upload
- Retry capability
